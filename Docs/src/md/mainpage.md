# Welcome to the AYON Usd Resolver Project

The Ayon USD Resolver enables resolution of Ayon URIs and pinning files using Pixar's Open USD.

**Distribution**
We distribute pre-compiled binaries via LakeFS and the AyonUsd add-on.

**Main Features**

- **URI Resolution**: This feature ensures highly portable USD scenes. The server continually tracks your file storage locations, allowing you to open scenes with absolute resolved paths from anywhere.

- **Pinning Support**: Run USD at render farm scale with this feature. Pinning files act as a cache for your resolver, eliminating the need to communicate with the Ayon Server. This avoids traditional issues associated with URI-based resolvers at scale.
